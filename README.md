This repository contains recipes for some Snaps.

[Snap](http://snapcraft.io/) and [Flatpak](http://flatpak.org/) are cool new ways
of distributing Linux applications among a wide range of different distros. They
are technologies to deploy applications in a secure, sandboxed and containerised way.

I personally have B1 and `john` installed on my machine. As they are packages, these applications will work for some
time even after OS updates. But, especially in the case of B1, this won't last forever.

#### Ubuntu Snap Packages

- John the ripper, a password auditing software: check [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) for more details. See the [Installation notes](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages#john-the-ripper-packages).
- Namebench, a benchmark tool: check [namebench](https://code.google.com/archive/p/namebench)
for more details.
- B1, a file archiver: check [B1](http://b1.org/) for more details.

All the Snap packages are built using a "professional" build server. At this moment, I'm using
**Launchpad** to build the Snap packages.

Anyone can get, for free (as in beer), the reviewed packages from [**Snap Store**](https://snapcraft.io/store?categories=security).

## Security

Please inspect all packages prior to running any of them to ensure safety.
We already know they're safe, but you should verify the security and contents of any
binary from the internet you are not familiar with.

We take security very seriously.
